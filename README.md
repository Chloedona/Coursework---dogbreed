This code is designed to:

Identify the most similar sequence
• Context: you want to develop a DNA identification service for dog breeds
• Identify the closest sequence in the database to the provided sequence 
• Input: sequence database (adapted from GEO), test sequence 
• Output: the closest sequence, and the difference 
• Stretch goal 1: Probabilities across database, p-value 
• Stretch goal 2: reconstructed phylogeny

This code uses packages:
BioPython for sequence analysis
